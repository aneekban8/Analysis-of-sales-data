# Make_Up
Analysis of sales data for sales made by 9 salespersons over a year. Bar graph of sales made by each person, in each product category, was made using Python. User can input the year he wants to create the graph for from among the six years (2004, 2005, 2006, 2020, 2021, 2022). The code will check if the user provides valid input from among these 6 years.

The file MakeUP_IVY_No_VBA_extra_data.xlsx contains an example of a Dynamic Chart in the sheet "Dynamic_Chart". For some background, the data in Sheet1 contains data on 6 salespersons for year 2022. The data contains data on 8 salespersons for the year 2021. The data contains data on 7 salespersons for the year 2020. Once you select the year from the dropdown in Cell C4, the chart will automatically update.
